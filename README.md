# Number Categorizer

This Dart program categorizes a list of numbers into even or odd using a for loop and switch case.

## Description
- The list of numbers is iterated using a for loop.
- A switch case checks each number:
  - If divisible by 2 (`% 2 == 0`), it’s even.
  - Otherwise, it’s odd.
- The result is printed to the console.

## Output
Example output:
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
